**Three algorithms will be used for this application:**

● Backtracking 

● Backtracking with forward checking 

● Backtracking with forward checking and arc consistency





**The Tkinter GUI supports:**

● Generating random board of a size that the user will provide (e.g. 3x3). 

● Choosing one of the 3 algorithms that will be used to check the user's answers.

● Generating boards of different sizes for up to 7x7.




**The React GUI supports:**

● Generating random board of a size that the user will provide (e.g. 3x3). 

● Choosing one of the 3 algorithms that will be used to check the user's answers.

● Running the solver to fill the board with the answer.

● Generating boards of different sizes with no upper limit.
